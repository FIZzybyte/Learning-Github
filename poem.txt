The fishes, the bastards, and the sneetches

One fish
Two fish
Red fish
Blue fish.
Black fish
Blue fish
Old fish
New fish.
This one has a little star.
This one has a little car.
Say! What a lot
Of fish there are.
Yes. Some are red. And some are blue.
Some are old. And some are new.
Some are sad.
And some are glad.
And some are very, very bad.

Of all the animals I’ve ever met
The Flustards, I think, are the silliest yet.
Poor Flustards! They spend every hour every day
In front of their house in a most stupid way....
Standing. Just standing. They’re waiting, they say.

If you go to Aw-WawHoo
And walk down the beach,
You’ll notice a sort-of-a-bird called the Sneetch.
In fact, there are two sorts of Sneetches you’ll find:
The Star-Belly kind, and the Plain-Belly kind.
The Star-Belly Sneetches have bellies with stars.
The Plain-Belly Sneetches don’t have them on thars.
